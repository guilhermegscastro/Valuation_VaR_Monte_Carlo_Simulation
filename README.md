# Valuation, Value at Risk and Monte Carlo Simulation

## Valuation_Model_FCFF.py:

1. This file focuses on the valuation of a company using the Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) model.
2. It calculates the present value of future free cash flows, taking into account discount rates, growth rates, and terminal values.
3. The model provides an estimate of the intrinsic value of a firm based on its financial performance and assumptions about future growth.

## Monte_Carlo_Simulation.py:

1. This script performs a Monte Carlo simulation to model stock price movements using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) approach.
2. It generates multiple price paths for a given stock, analyzes the expected return and risk, and visualizes the results using plots.
3. It includes parameters such as the initial stock price, expected return, volatility, time period, and number of simulations.

## VaR_Model.py:

1. The script calculates Value at Risk (VaR) for a portfolio using both the historical and variance-covariance methods.
2. It quantifies the potential loss in the portfolio's value over a specified time frame, given a certain confidence level.
3. The code also includes risk measures and visualizations to interpret the VaR results effectively.

## Dependencies
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scipy (for the VaR Model)
